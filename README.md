### Signal Processing Framework Development 
This project is a framework for signal processing using Python, designed to help visualize and manipulate signals with various features.

# DSP Task 1 - Signal Processing Framework
## Features

### 1. Reading and Displaying Signals
- **Read Samples from a Text File**: The framework allows the user to load signal samples from a `.txt` file.
- **Continuous and Discrete Representation**: The signal can be displayed in both continuous and discrete-time forms for better visualization and analysis.

### 2. Signal Generation
- **Sinusoidal and Cosinusoidal Signals**: Users can generate sinusoidal or cosinusoidal signals with customizable parameters, including:
  - **Amplitude (A)**: Control the height of the wave.
  - **Phase Shift (Î¸)**: Adjust the phase of the wave.
  - **Analog Frequency (f)**: Set the frequency of the analog signal.
  - **Sampling Frequency (fs)**: Define the sampling rate (must satisfy the sampling theorem).
  
- The framework includes a **Signal Generation** menu with two options:
  1. **Sine Wave**
  2. **Cosine Wave**

### 3. Multiple Signal Display
- The framework supports displaying two signals at the same time for comparison and analysis.

## Usage
1. **Reading Signal Samples from a File**: Place your signal samples in a `.txt` file and load it into the framework to visualize the signal.
2. **Generating a Signal**:
   - From the menu, choose to generate a sine or cosine wave.
   - Input the required parameters like amplitude, phase shift, and frequency.
3. **Simultaneous Signal Display**: The framework allows two signals to be displayed at once for a side-by-side comparison.
