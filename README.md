# Signal Processing Framework Development ðŸ“ŠðŸ§®
This project is a framework for signal processing using Python, designed to help visualize and manipulate signals with various features.

# ðŸ”² Task 1 - Signal Processing Framework
## Features

### 1. Reading and Displaying Signals
- **Read Samples from a Text File**: The framework allows the user to load signal samples from a `.txt` file.
- **Continuous and Discrete Representation**: The signal can be displayed in both continuous and discrete-time forms for better visualization and analysis.

### 2. Signal Generation
- **Sinusoidal and Cosinusoidal Signals**: Users can generate sinusoidal or cosinusoidal signals with customizable parameters, including:
  - **Amplitude (A)**: Control the height of the wave.
  - **Phase Shift (Î¸)**: Adjust the phase of the wave.
  - **Analog Frequency (f)**: Set the frequency of the analog signal.
  - **Sampling Frequency (fs)**: Define the sampling rate (must satisfy the sampling theorem).
  
- The framework includes a **Signal Generation** menu with two options:
  1. **Sine Wave**
  2. **Cosine Wave**

### 3. Multiple Signal Display
- The framework supports displaying two signals at the same time for comparison and analysis.

## ðŸŽ¯Usage
1. **Reading Signal Samples from a File**: Place your signal samples in a `.txt` file and load it into the framework to visualize the signal.
2. **Generating a Signal**:
   - From the menu, choose to generate a sine or cosine wave.
   - Input the required parameters like amplitude, phase shift, and frequency.
3. **Simultaneous Signal Display**: The framework allows two signals to be displayed at once for a side-by-side comparison.

# ðŸ”² Task 2 - Signal Processing Framework with Arithmetic Operations
## Features

### 1. Arithmetic Operations Menu
- **Addition**: Add multiple input signals and display the resulting signal.
- **Subtraction**: Subtract input signals and display the resulting signal.
- **Multiplication**: Multiply a signal by a constant to either amplify or reduce the signalâ€™s amplitude (invert if the constant equals -1).
- **Squaring**: Square the signal and display the resulting signal.

# ðŸ”² Task 3 - Signal Quantization

### Features

- **Quantization of Input Signals**: The framework allows the user to quantize a signal by specifying either:
  - **Number of Levels**: Directly input the levels needed.
  - **Number of Bits**: The application will compute the appropriate number of levels based on the number of bits.

- **Signal Display**: The application will display:
  - **Quantized Signal**: The quantized version of the input signal.
  - **Quantization Error**: The error between the original and quantized signal.
  - **Encoded Signal**: The encoded representation of the quantized signal.
    
## ðŸŽ¯ Usage
1. ** Quantize Signals**: Quantize an input signal by selecting the number of levels or bits and visualize the quantization error and encoded signal.

# ðŸ”² Task 4 - Frequency Domain

### Features

- **Fourier Transform**: Apply Fourier transform to any input signal and display frequency versus amplitude and frequency versus phase relations. The user will be prompted to enter the sampling frequency in Hz.
  
- **Modify Signal Components**: Allow modification of the amplitude and phase of the signalâ€™s frequency components.

- **Signal Reconstruction (IDFT)**: Reconstruct the signal using Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform (IDFT).

- **Save Frequency Components**: Save the frequency components of the signal in a `.txt` file in polar form (amplitude and phase).

- **Read Frequency Components**: Read a `.txt` file containing frequency components in polar form and reconstruct the signal using IDFT.

**Hint**: Due to the similarity between DFT and IDFT, the code should be designed smartly to handle both transformations efficiently.

## ðŸŽ¯ Usage
1. **Fourier Transform**: Input a signal, apply the Fourier transform, and view the frequency domain components (amplitude and phase).
2. **Modify Components**: Adjust the frequency components and view the updated signal in both time and frequency domains.
3. **Reconstruction**: Use IDFT to reconstruct the signal from its frequency components, either by computing them or loading from a file.
4. **Save & Load**: Save the frequency components of the signal in polar form and reload them to reconstruct the signal.

# ðŸ”² Task 5 - Frequency Domain Enhancements

### Features

- **Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)**: Compute the DCT for a given input signal. Display the result and allow the user to choose the first `m` coefficients to be saved in a `.txt` file.

- **Remove DC Component**: Provide the functionality to remove the DC component from the signal.

## ðŸŽ¯ Usage
1. **Compute DCT**: Apply DCT to an input signal, view the result, and save the first `m` coefficients if desired.
2. **Remove DC Component**: Process the signal to remove the DC component.

- **Second Derivative**: Compute and display the second derivative of the input signal \( Y(n) = x(n+1) - 2x(n) + x(n-1) \).

### 3. Delaying or Advancing
- **Delay or Advance**: Shift the signal by \( k \) steps either forward (advancing) or backward (delaying).

### 4. Folding
- **Signal Folding**: Fold the signal to visualize its symmetric properties.

### 5. Delaying or Advancing a Folded Signal
- **Delay or Advance Folded Signal**: Shift the folded signal by \( k \) steps.
